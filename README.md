## üöÄ Project Description

NIRMAAN is a modular, single-page frontend designed to advertise a hackathon or event and collect registrations. The site‚Äôs purpose is to:

- Present event branding and details (hero, date/time, prizes, judging criteria).
- Explain participant benefits and sponsors.
- Provide a registration flow (embedded Google Form) and a project-submission page (also embedded).
- Serve as a lightweight static site that can be deployed to any static host.

This repository intentionally contains no server-side code; it‚Äôs meant to be deployed as static assets or integrated with a simple backend later.

## üåê Environment

The project uses static embeds for Google Forms by default. For safer configuration and easier deployment, use Vite environment variables.

Create an `.env` and set:
```bash
VITE_REG_FORM_URL=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/<REGISTRATION_FORM_ID>/viewform?embedded=true
VITE_SUBMISSION_FORM_URL=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/<SUBMISSION_FORM_ID>/viewform?embedded=true
```

Example snippet to use in components (replace iframe `src` with the env var):
```bash
// pages/RegistrationPage.tsx
const formUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_REG_FORM_URL ?? 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_FORM_ID/viewform?embedded=true';
<iframe src={formUrl} ... />
```

**Notes:**
- Vite exposes client vars only if prefixed with VITE_.
- Keep private/unwanted form URLs out of the repository by using environment variables.

## üß™ Usage examples

**Run locally (dev)**
```bash
npm run dev
# visit http://localhost:5173
```

**Change the hero date/time**  
Edit `components/Hero.tsx` and find:
```bash
<span className="text-lg md:text-2xl">Nov 26, 2024</span>
<span className="text-lg md:text-2xl">10 AM - 12 PM</span>
```
Replace with the desired date/time or convert these into configurable props/env variables.  

**Update features / prizes**  
Edit `components/EventDetails.tsx` - the features are defined in the features array. Add, remove or update entries:  
```bash
const features = [
  { icon: <Trophy />, title: 'Prizes Worth ‚Çπ50,000', description: '...' },
  // ...
];
```
